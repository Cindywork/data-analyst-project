## Trupanion Data Scientist Skill Assessment Solutions

The original files are put into the folder './Original'

The solutions are located inside './Solution' folder, there you can find:

* p1_solution.csv

  This file has the mapping from id_lineitem to id_labeled

* p2_data_solved.csv

  This file has the model predicted labels for the last 1000 records


* 'Build a text classifier .ipynb'

  For this problem, I've used Power BI to explore the data, you'll find two figures inside this file, I've trained a Text CNN deep learning model to predict the labels, the trained model checkpoint is saved under './Chkpt' folder.
