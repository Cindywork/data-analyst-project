## Trupanion Data Scientist Skill Assessment Solutions

The original files are put into the folder './Original'

The solutions are located inside './Solution' folder, there you can find:

* p1_solution.csv

  This file has the mapping from id_lineitem to id_labeled

* p2_data_solved.csv

  This file has the model predicted labels for the last 1000 records

* Please note there is no p3 solution file here, as it is answered directly inside the jupyter notebook file

All the homeowrk are done using jupyter notebooks, you can find the report in these files:

* Part 1 solution report: 'Part 1 Preparing a usable dataset.ipynb'

  Two depth first search algorithm is used for the purpose of solving the problem

* Part 2 solution report: 'Part 2 Build a text classifier .ipynb'

  For this problem, I've used Power BI to explore the data, you'll find two figures inside this file, I've trained a Text CNN deep learning model to predict the labels, the trained model checkpoint is saved under './Chkpt' folder.

* Part 3 solution report: 'Part 3 Short answer.ipynb'
